# Flight Delay Classification 
Performance evaluation of Machine Learning 

One of the most daunting tasks with machine learning and deep learning is determining the best relationship between methods
and their suitability with a given data preprocessing for best performance during classification or prediction task with a given dataset. 
This is because there is no fixed rule in determining such relationship as the performance of a model is mostly determined by so many factors and indicators involved in training the model as well as the view and approach in taking incleaning and preprocessing the dataset based on the target output.
